## Scatterplot
```{r scatterplot}
# data() to look at R data
g<- ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy)) # data is df aes= aesthetic
  g+ geom_point() # this creates a scatterplot 

```
#### `write header in code format with backslashes ` 

```{r color2}
  g+ geom_point(aes(color= class)) # used another aes for specific layer
# the following creates the same plot 
# g<- ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class))+
# g + geom_point()
```
#### but i need a black and white figure
changed `color` to `shape`
```{r b&w}
 ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy, shape=class))+
geom_point()
```

#### `shape`: create a different shape per point

```{r shape}
  g+ geom_point(aes(color= class)) # used another aes for specific layer
# the following creates the same plot 
# g<- ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y=hwy, color=class))+
# g + geom_point()
```

#### `size` change the size of the points

```{r size}
  ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=cty, y=hwy, size=class, color=fl)) +
            geom_point(alpha=0.2) # alpha changes transparency
        
```
```{r fix color}
  ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=cty, y=hwy, size=class, color=fl)) +
            geom_point(alpha=0.2, color="blue") # this changes the color to all blue
        
```
## Exercise 
```{r exercise 1}
  ggplot(data=mpg) +
            geom_point(aes(x= displ, y=hwy), color= "blue")
        
```
## Geoms
``` {r geom_examples}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=drv, y=hwy)) +
  geom_jitter()
````
## Geoms
``` {r geom_example2}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=drv, y=hwy)) +
  geom_boxplot() # violin plot is geom_violin()
````

## Geoms_ violin
``` {r geom_example3}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x=drv, y=hwy)) +
  geom_violin() # violin plot is geom_violin()
````
## multiple geoms
``` {r another geom ex}
ggplot(data=mpg) +
  geom_point(aes(x=drv, y=hwy))+
  geom_smooth(aes(x= displ, y=hwy))# different smooth methods, this was 'loess
````
``` {r same as above}
ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y= hwy)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth()
````


``` {r change text}
ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y= hwy)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Relationship b/w engine size and mpg",
       x= "Highway MPG",
       y= "Engine Displ" ) +
  theme_bw() +  # changes background
  theme(text = element_text(size = 10))
````

``` {r exercise2}
ggplot(data=mpg, aes(x=displ, y= hwy)) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth() +
  labs(title="Relationship b/w engine size and mpg",
       x= "Highway MPG",

## Data wrangling with `dplyr` 
Today we will be working with Gap Minder data
WE are going to read it in from GitHub 

```{r github upload}
# click on raw in git hub repository
# copy url from git hub
gapminder <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OHI-Science/data-science-training/master/data/gapminder.csv")
gapminder # bc read_csv very viewable 

#### useful functions to get to know your data:
head(gapminder) # first 6 rows of data
tail(gapminder) # tail show the last 6 rows of data 

head(gapminder, 10) # "can pass how many lines you want to see"

str(gapminder) # examines the structure of your data-- also tells you the dimensions of the dimensions
## column names 
names (gapminder) # returns column headers
## dimensions of the data
dim(gapminder) 
ncol(gapminder) # number of columns
nrow(gapminder) # number of rows 
## combine with c()
c(nrow(gapminder), ncol(gapminder)) # another way to view your dimersions "build dimensions"

## summary
summary(gapminder)  # statistical summary of each column in the dataset 

## for everything above, we were operating on the whole gapminder dataset

## column
head(gapminder$lifeExp) # comand arrow key will get you from front and back
# option arrows -- can flip between words and or shift keys?? will allow you to highlight them





```
## Actually working with dplyr
we will be playing around with the many types of subseting: filter is the main one, select allows you to pull out specific columns +mutate allows you to add a new column. Summarize columns is if you made a summary stat such as mean that gives you a single value. Finally arrange() allows you to rearrange rows
Group by: lets you work with groups 

for all verbs:
1. the first argument is a df
2. describe what you are going to do with your data
3. result is a new df 

## filter - pulling rows out
```{r}
filter(gapminder, lifeExp < 29) # returns only those rows that meet this criteria
# goign to filter gapminder data so life expectancy is less than 29 (literate programing)

filter(gapminder, country=="Mexico") # selects only those rows where countries equal mexico, returns all columns 

# what is the mean life expectancy of sweden
sweden <- filter(gapminder, country=="Sweden")
mean(sweden$lifeExp)

mean(filter(gapminder, country=="Sweden")$lifeExp) # same as above 

## pipe operator `%>%` -- searchcommand+ shift+ m also creates a pipe operator
 gapminder %>% head(3) # set the data, then do a function data "and then" for pipe operator same as head(gapminder, 3)-- can still assign variables ! 
 
## lets use the pipe for sweden example 
y <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(country== "Sweden") %>% 
  summarize(mean_lifeExp= mean(lifeExp)) # ALWAYS returns a df 
# bc of that we had to create a new column "mean_lifeExp" and can view classes
# "take the  gapminder data, filter by sweden and then take mean of life exp

```

## select by columns with select function 
```{r}
## select 2 columns
select(gapminder, year, lifeExp) # returns the same amount of rows, but only 2 columns

## same as above but with pipe operator 
gapminder %>% 
  select(year, lifeExp) %>%
  tail(10)

## combine what we have learned so far..

gapminder %>%
  filter(country=="Cambodia")  %>% # selects for only the country of cambodia
  select(country, year, pop, gdpPercap)

## same as above
gapminder %>%
  filter(country=="Cambodia") %>%
  select(-continent, -lifeExp) # just a clear way to do the above - means not that column

##  a few more thanks with filter -- can filter for more than one thing
gapminder %>%
  filter(country=="Mexico", 
         year==2002) # this selects only one row for mexico from 2002

# if not indented, auto indent ORkeyboard shortbut select code and goto command i- will re indent line (will work for whole script of selected text)

```

## `mutate()` to add columns 
```{r}
## mutate can add a new column
gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp= pop*gdpPercap) # this adds a new column with our new column 

## lets add an index column
gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp= pop*gdpPercap) %>%
  mutate(index= 1:nrow(gapminder)) %>%
  tail()

## OR could have both in one mutate function
test <- gapminder %>%
  mutate(gdp= pop*gdpPercap, 
         index= 1:nrow(gapminder)) %>%
          tail()

# this is not the right way, use %in% intead
gapminder %>%
  filter(country==c("Egypt", "Vietnam")) # can filter by two countries
         
# in operator lets you filter multiple things c() within a c bind
gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Egypt", "Vietnam"))
```

## exercise max gdpPercap of Egypt and vietnam
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Egypt", "Vietnam")) %>%
  summarize(max(gdpPercap)) # this created only one value... this was not what she was looking for, see below:

  gapminder %>%
  filter(country %in% c("Egypt", "Vietnam")) %>%
  mutate(max_gdpPerCap=max(gdpPercap)) # creates a new column with all of these values
```

## group_by()so that we can get 2 maxes
```{r}
gapminder%>%
  filter(country %in% c("Egypt", "Vietnam")) %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(max_gdpPercap= max(gdpPercap))
  # mutate(max_gdpPerCap= max(gdpPerCap)) 
# this returns the max from each country 
# could also do this without assigning a name, but it uses a column name based on your function 

gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  summarize(max_gdpPercap=max(gdpPercap))


## lets keep the year associated with max gdp variable max_gdpPecap
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(max_gdpPercap= max(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(max_gdpPercap == max(gdpPercap))

## another way to create the same thing
gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  #mutate(max_gdpPercap= max(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(gdpPercap == max(gdpPercap))
  
  
  gapminder %>%
  group_by(country) %>%
  mutate(max_gdpPercap= max(gdpPercap)) %>%
  filter(max_gdpPercap == max(gdpPercap))%>%
  arrange(max_gdpPercap) # if you want descending order, use arrange(desc(max_gdpPercap))

```



`read_csv` is from the read r package (part of the tidyverse)- it is not read.csv() from {base}
